Static fullscreen HTML image application for a screen. A very rudimentary sample of a web application that can be shown on a digital screen. Great for use with charlieuniform (Coming soon, currently in Beta.)

This app displays an image of your choice that fills the entire screen of your digital display. It optionally can show a static message.

## CharlieUniform
